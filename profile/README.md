Theoretica is a group of physicists, mathematicians and programmers dedicated to advancing open research and development in science through **scientific computing**.
We are committed to promoting the democratization of knowledge, providing open source software libraries and resources.

## Projects
- [**Theoretica Math**](https://chaotic-society.github.com/theoretica)
  > A modular and header-only library in C++ for scientific computing, with numerical methods of wide interest.

- [**Chebyshev Test**](http://chaotic-society.github.com/chebyshev)
  > A unit testing and numerical validation framework for scientific software.

## Our Team
Our team is composed of young and enthusiastic students and researchers,
who bring a fresh perspective to the table. Our work ranges from creating tools for **numerical
simulations** to developing algorithms that solve intricate **mathematical
problems**, all with the aim of making cutting-edge scientific research
accessible to everyone.

## Our Philosophy
Theoretica stands for a democratic access to research results and knowledge. By offering
our software under **open source** licenses, we ensure that anyone, anywhere,
can contribute to, learn from, and build upon the projects we support.

Theoretica is a community united by a shared vision of a future where science is **open**,
**accessible**, and driven by the collective intelligence of its practitioners.
