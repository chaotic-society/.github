Theoretica is a pioneering organization dedicated to advancing **scientific
computing** through the development and research of open-source software.
At its core, Theoretica is committed to fostering **open access research** and
promoting the flow of knowledge. With a primary focus on developing
quality scientific computing libraries, Theoretica leverages the
robustness and efficiency of C++, a language chosen for its performance
and versatility in handling complex mathematical computations.

## Our Team
Our team is predominantly composed of young and enthusiastic **physicists
and mathematicians**, who bring a fresh perspective to the
table. We are not just developers, we are passionate researchers and
educators. Our work ranges from creating tools for **numerical
simulations** to developing algorithms that solve intricate **mathematical
problems**, all with the aim of making cutting-edge scientific research
accessible to everyone.

## Our Philosophy
Theoretica stands for the **democratization of scientific discovery**. By offering
its software under open-source licenses, it ensures that anyone, anywhere,
can contribute to, learn from, and build upon the projects it supports. This
approach not only accelerates **scientific progress**, but also
empowers a new generation of scientists and engineers to explore the
unknown with confidence and creativity.

Theoretica is more than just a software development organization; it is a
community united by a shared vision of a future where science is **open**,
**accessible**, and driven by the collective intelligence of its practitioners.
Through its commitment to open-source principles, Theoretica strives for a
new era of scientific exploration, one line of code at a time.
