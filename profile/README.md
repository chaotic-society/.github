Theoretica is a young collective of physicists, mathematicians, and programmers who are passionate about pushing the boundaries of **open research** and development in science through **scientific computing**. We believe in the democratization of knowledge, and our mission is to provide open-source software and resources that empower everyone to engage with science.

## Projects
- [**Theoretica Math**](https://github.com/chaotic-society/theoretica)
  > A modular and header-only library in C++ for scientific computing, with numerical methods of wide use.

- [**Chebyshev Test**](http://github.com/chaotic-society/chebyshev)
  > A unit testing and numerical validation framework for scientific software.

### Exploratory Projects
- [**Theoretica Lab**](http://github.com/chaotic-society/theoretica-lab)
  > A place to explore new ideas and theories together.

- [**Metropolis**](http://github.com/chaotic-society/metropolis)
  > The Metropolis sampling algorithm and its variants.

## Our Team
Our team is made up of enthusiastic students and researchers eager to create innovative, open solutions for scientific computing. From crafting tools for numerical simulations to developing algorithms that tackle complex computational challenges, our work is about making cutting-edge scientific research accessible to all. We champion the idea that research results and knowledge should be available to everyone, not just a select few.

## Our Principles
By offering our software under open-source licenses, we invite everyone to contribute, learn, and build upon the projects we create. We envision a future where science is **open**, **accessible**, and fueled by the **collective intelligence** of its practitioners. Together, we can shape a scientific landscape that thrives on collaboration and shared discovery.
